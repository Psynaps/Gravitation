### Gravitation

This is my implementation of gravitation and the three body problem using P5.js. The heart of the physics is Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, F = G*m1*m2/r^2. 
The reset button reinitializes the three bodies at random positions with random initial velocities. The stable button resets to a stable configuration which forms a figure eight first discovered in 1993.
