### Gravitation

This is my implementation of gravitation and the three body problem using P5.js. The heart of the physics is Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, F = G*m1*m2/r^2. 
The reset button reinitializes the three bodies at random positions with random initial velocities. The "Pause" button clears the simulation and allows you to place bodies by clicking in the window with the mouse to create a body at the cursor. The simulation can be resumed once bodis are placed by pressing "Resume"
